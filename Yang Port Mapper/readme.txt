***YANG Port Mapper Readme***

Thanks for trying this program, in hope it helps some of you hosting YANG Rooms and connecting to other players using the Source Ports.

Please ensure that "upnp.exe" and the "miniupnpc.dll" are in the same folder/directory as the application.

YANG Port Mapper launches the MiniUPnP Project "upnp.exe", which can be found at "http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/".



This program will try to temporarily forward your ports on your router using UPnP.

Most routers will have UPnP enabled by default, making it a really simply process to forward 
ports for YANG.

This is for people that have trouble setting up "Port Forwarding" or find it complicated.

This usually works, but in some cases it will not work for you.

If it doesn't work, you can try and login to your "Router Settings" and try enabling UPnP.

Once you have clicked on "Try Forward Ports", then try and continue on YANG as per usual.

To check what ports YANG uses, click on the “Settings" menu, then choose “Multiplayer and 
networking”, and finally choose the “Networking” tab.
